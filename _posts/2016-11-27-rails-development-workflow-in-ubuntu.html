<p>
	Ubuntu is the choice of OS for most of the developers who prefer working in linux based dev machines. I am one of them and I mostly do ruby-on-rails based dev work. This post outlines the tools and general workflow for using ubuntu for dev work in rails.

			<li>- <i>Terminal toggling on/off with key binding:</i> You can just toggle guake terminal window to appear or hide based on a key-binding (default is F12)</li>
